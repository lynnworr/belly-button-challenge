# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge I built a dashboard that displayed info based on participants in a belly button biodiversity study. 

On the dashboard, you will see a dropdown list with the subjects ID number, a demographic box, a barchart with outcomes for each subject and a bubble chart showing
the distribution of the data. 

When a new subject is chosen, each graph and chart will change and show each individual subjects outcomes.
